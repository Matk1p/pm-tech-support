### üîÑ Auto-Updating Knowledge Base

The system now automatically learns from support interactions:

**How it works:**
1. When support team members reply to tickets with solutions, the system detects solution keywords
2. AI extracts a clean Q&A pair from the original ticket and solution
3. The knowledge base is automatically updated with the new information
4. Future similar questions will be answered automatically without creating tickets

**Triggering automatic updates:**
Reply to support tickets using phrases like:
- "Solution: [your solution]"
- "Fix: [steps to resolve]" 
- "To resolve this: [solution]"
- "Here's how to fix: [steps]"
- Include "add to kb" or "for future reference" in your reply

**Manual knowledge base updates:**
- `POST /update-knowledge-base` - Manually add solutions to knowledge base
- `POST /test-knowledge-update` - Test the update functionality
- `GET /knowledge-stats` - View knowledge base statistics
